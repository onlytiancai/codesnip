- Giving agents access to a sandboxed environment with a shell and a filesystem has been the latest hype when it comes to agentic harnesses.
    - hype /haɪp/ 大肆的宣传广告，炒作；
    - harnesses /ˈhɑːr.nəsɪz/ 用具 
- The argument for why this is good goes something like this:
    - argument /ˈɑːɡjumənt/ 论据，理由；
- The big labs are doing heavy RL for coding tasks in these kinds of environments. 
- Aligning more closely with such a harness brings free gains from the coding domain to other problem spaces.
    - harness /ˈhɑːnɪs/ 用具
- Beyond that, replacing a bunch of search/write/move/list tools with a single Bash tool reduces the tool space significantly. 
- Agents can chain operations together intuitively. Unix paradigms give you good tool design for free.
    - paradigms /ˈpærədaɪm/ 范式
- On top of that there is more nice patterns that emerge from having a filesystem.
- Plan/scratch files: Agents can create temporary files to organize their thoughts, track progress, or store intermediate results. 
    - intermediate /ˌɪntəˈmiːdiət/ 中间的
- This emerges naturally from having filesystem access, no need to design a separate “notepad” tool.
- Long context handling: As conversations grow, you can compact old messages and tool results into files on the filesystem. 
- The agent can re-read them when needed rather than keeping everything in context.
- So the advantages are clear. But how do you actually apply this to your domain?  This is where things get tricky. 
- A domain with parallels to filesystems: For example an agent for organizing emails. 
    - parallels /ˈpærəlels/ 类似于...的，平行于
- There are folders, items (emails), and you can browse them and move things around.
- An existing platform that already looks like a filesystem: For example an agent inside Google Drive.
- When you try to fit these into a sandboxed filesystem you might wonder:
- When do I copy over the files?
- Do I copy over everything?
- How do I write back updates that the agent made?
- When do I sync edits made by a human?
- How do I show folders/files progressively as the agent progresses?
- (Particularly useful if you want to lean into the filesystem as a tool to manage long context.)
- A reply to a recent post on X from Vercel about building filesystem-based agents puts it well:
- This article doesn’t really answer that question though.
- They explain the shape of the filesystem really well, 
    - shape 形状，结构
- but the missing piece is still the main question for existing apps: 
- how do you actually materialize Postgres + object storage + APIs into that sandbox FS in a practical and scalable way? 
    - materialize /məˈtɪəriəlaɪz/ 实现，成为现实；
- “Preload files” is hand-wavy without a recommended ingestion/snapshot pattern.0l0

Abstract—Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn alot of attention due to their strong performance on a widerange of natural language tasks, since the release of ChatGPTin November 2022. LLMs’ ability of general-purpose languageunderstanding and generation is acquired by training billions ofmodel’s parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predictedby scaling laws [1], [2]. The research area of LLMs, while veryrecent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper,we review some of the most prominent LLMs, including threepopular LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss theircharacteristics, contributions and limitations. We also give anoverview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs.We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training,fine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluationmetrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMson a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we concludethe paper by discussing open challenges and future researchdirections.

The software industry sits at a strange inflection point. AI coding has evolved from autocomplete on steroids to agents that can autonomously execute development tasks. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree has given way to an efficiency mandate: companies now often favor profitability over growth, experienced hires over fresh graduates, and smaller teams armed with better tools.

体会区别：

1. The economic boom that tech’s hiring spree fueled.
2. The economic boom fueled by tech’s hiring spree.
3. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree.
4. The economic boom that was fueled by tech’s hiring spree.
