- Giving agents access to a sandboxed environment with a shell and a filesystem has been the latest hype when it comes to agentic harnesses.
    - hype /haɪp/ 大肆的宣传广告，炒作；
    - harnesses /ˈhɑːr.nəsɪz/ 用具 
- The argument for why this is good goes something like this:
    - argument /ˈɑːɡjumənt/ 论据，理由；
- The big labs are doing heavy RL for coding tasks in these kinds of environments. 
- Aligning more closely with such a harness brings free gains from the coding domain to other problem spaces.
    - harness /ˈhɑːnɪs/ 用具
- Beyond that, replacing a bunch of search/write/move/list tools with a single Bash tool reduces the tool space significantly. 
- Agents can chain operations together intuitively. Unix paradigms give you good tool design for free.
    - paradigms /ˈpærədaɪm/ 范式
- On top of that there is more nice patterns that emerge from having a filesystem.
- Plan/scratch files: Agents can create temporary files to organize their thoughts, track progress, or store intermediate results. 
    - intermediate /ˌɪntəˈmiːdiət/ 中间的
- This emerges naturally from having filesystem access, no need to design a separate “notepad” tool.
- Long context handling: As conversations grow, you can compact old messages and tool results into files on the filesystem. 
- The agent can re-read them when needed rather than keeping everything in context.
- So the advantages are clear. But how do you actually apply this to your domain?  This is where things get tricky. 
- A domain with parallels to filesystems: For example an agent for organizing emails. 
    - parallels /ˈpærəlels/ 类似于...的，平行于
- There are folders, items (emails), and you can browse them and move things around.
- An existing platform that already looks like a filesystem: For example an agent inside Google Drive.
- When you try to fit these into a sandboxed filesystem you might wonder:
- When do I copy over the files?
- Do I copy over everything?
- How do I write back updates that the agent made?
- When do I sync edits made by a human?
- How do I show folders/files progressively as the agent progresses?
- (Particularly useful if you want to lean into the filesystem as a tool to manage long context.)
- A reply to a recent post on X from Vercel about building filesystem-based agents puts it well:
- This article doesn’t really answer that question though.
- They explain the shape of the filesystem really well, 
    - shape 形状，结构
- but the missing piece is still the main question for existing apps: 
- how do you actually materialize Postgres + object storage + APIs into that sandbox FS in a practical and scalable way? 
    - materialize /məˈtɪəriəlaɪz/ 实现，成为现实；
- “Preload files” is hand-wavy without a recommended ingestion/snapshot pattern.0l0
