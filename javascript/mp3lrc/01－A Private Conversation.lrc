[00:12.81]Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?
[00:20.63]Last week I went to the theatre.
[00:24.14]I had a very good seat.
[00:27.47]The play was very interesting.
[00:30.66]I did not enjoy it.
[00:33.49]A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
[00:38.25]They were talking loudly.
[00:40.72]I got very angry.
[00:43.39]I could not hear the actors.
[00:46.53]I turned round.
[00:49.08]I looked at the man and the woman angrily.
[00:53.55]They did not pay any attention.
[00:56.25]In the end  I could not bear it.
[00:59.78]I turned round again.
[01:02.47]'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
[01:07.32]'It's none of your business ' the young man said rudely.
[01:11.82]'This is a private conversation!'
